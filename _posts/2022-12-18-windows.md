![alt text](/assets/img/windows/9.0.1-BSB-Design.jpg)
This puts image in at its default size and text will appear wherever.

<p align="left" width="100%">
    <img width="40%" src="/assets/img/windows/9.0.1-BSB-Design.jpg"> 
</p>
This allows me to set the image width (size of photo), and the p alignment width being at 100% prevents text from being in line with image (text will go underneath or above image based on where text is entered)

<img align="left" width="50%" src="/assets/img/windows/architrave.jpg"> 

[Architrave (wiki entry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architrave) Image align places image at the left, width indicates how much of the screen the image will take up, and text will be in line with image. Also, shows how to include a web link.
